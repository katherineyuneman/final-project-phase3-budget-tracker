# Budget Tracker

** Basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React frontend

Budget Tracker is a web app that allows you to add a new monthly budget limit.  You can also add how much you spend during any budget month in the form of individual itemized transactions.

Only one Budget can be added per month, but a month and budget can have many different transactions related to it.  You can view your budget summary for the month by going to the My Dashboard section to see how much you've spent (Total Sum of all of your month's transactions) and how much you have left for the month depending on your budget.
